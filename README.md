# skills-vs-interests

## Description
Basic scatterplot visualising skills vs interests.
This is a work in progress. My goal is to build a nice visualisation to use in resum√©s, using d3.js. 

## Usage
To use the normal js version, just add an empty div with the id "my_plot" in your html and link to scatterplot.js. 

To use the react version, just add the react-scatterplot.js to your React app, and change the filename to Skills.js.

## Contributing
These are features I'm planning on implementing. Contributions are welcome.
- [ ] Preventing overlapping labels
- [ ] Add tooltip for descriptions
- [ ] Add some animations
